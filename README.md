## Calculu Machine


The library finds total derivatives (also partials as by-products) from multivariate system of equations of no derivatives.  Then it generates the new system of equations differential equations, and solve them from given inputs.

Sympy is used as the derivative calculation engine.  No integrals are used unlike regular differential equations.  Since integrals are inverse of derivatives, the system of equations calculates the inversions by its nature, and so in effect, it can solve the system of differential equations.

I belive the total derivatives are generally treated as obescure objects shadowed by partial derivatives.  I consider partial derivatives are merely coefficients within total derivatives and generated as by-products within the process.  They also reside in the function domain of the system whereas the total derivatives reside globally within the system.  Therefore, they can be used to derive scalar values by the system.
